* Deadling with system calls
symbolic.v

* Initial states: Did we sort that out? Doesn't seem so!
- defined wrongly as true for abstract machine
- defined as true for symbolic machine too

* Assumptions and Admits

These need to be carefully scrutinized

** Where is determinism actually used? [Nowhere, removed]
Defined TWICE (abstract.v and cfi.v)
- in abstract.v it should be Lemma not Hypothesis
Not used at all

** XXX
* Concrete machine
* Forward Simulation? (not a priority, but still)
+ Backwards refinement is already very automated
+ Definitions can be shared ... refinement relation, etc.
- Backwards refinement proof is still 1000+ lines
* Naming and notation

** Stick to Abadi's notations when possible
step -> step_n
step_cfi -> step

* Why are there things excluded from build?
