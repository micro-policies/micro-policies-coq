* Files

No need to append cfi_ in front of file names that live in cfi folder

Could rename cfi.v to property.v or machine.v?

Could consider moving cfi_rules.v into symbolic.v

* Naming and notation

** Stick to Abadi's notations when possible
step -> step_n
step_cfi -> step

* Why are there things excluded from build?

#cfi/cfi_preservation.v -- file removed

concrete stuff:
#cfi/concrete_cfi.v
#cfi/concrete_kernel.v
#cfi/fault_handler_spec.v

* Initial states: Did we sort that out? Doesn't seem so!
- defined wrongly as true for abstract machine
- defined as true for symbolic machine too

* Deadling with system calls

symbolic.v

* Assumptions

These need to be carefully scrutinized

** Where is determinism actually used? [Nowhere, removed]
Defined TWICE (abstract.v and cfi.v)
- in abstract.v it should be Lemma not Hypothesis
Not used at all
