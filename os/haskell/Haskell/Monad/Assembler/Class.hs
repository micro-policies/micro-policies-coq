Description : Monad class for assembling a Von Neumann-architecture machine

This module provides a 'MonadAssembler' monad class which models monads that
support generating the memory of a Von Neumann-architecture machine.  The
intended model of this class is the 'AssemblerT' monad transformer from
"Haskell.Monad.Trans.Assembler"; for more information and documentation, see
that module.
